# LOOK, a Discord Bot Written in Python

## Overview

Finally, I made my first discord bot online!

LOOK is a bot with some features that requires from people in my own discord server. It's just a project for me to sharpen my coding skill and learn how to write a discord bot. The bot is deploy through AWS currently.

## Features

- Commands with prefix `!`
- There are 4 functons about dinner.
    - `chooseDinner` randomly choose a dinner from the dinner list.
    - `addDinner <item>` adds additional choice to the dinner list.
    - `removeDinner <item>` removes certain choice from dinner list.
    - `listDinner` lists the dinner list.
- There are some systematical functions as well.
    - `ping` tests the bot connection status.
    - `help` types the help messages.

## Note

The bot is going to work until November in 2025. Bring some creative and innovative ideas about functionality of the bot to me if you have any idea!
